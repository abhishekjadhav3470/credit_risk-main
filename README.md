## Credit Card Default Prediction
### 1)Project Overview :
* Credit Card Default Prediction is a classification problem.
* Credit Card payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due (MAD) on the credit card for a few consecutive months.
* The goal of this project is to predict the probability of credit card default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.
* The dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.The project understands weather the other independent variables impacts default rate.
